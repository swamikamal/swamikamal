# Hi there 👋 I'm [Kamal Swami](https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hoodie-hacker.jpg)

I'm a student currently doing Computer Science and a professional gamer too. I love programming, blockchain development, cybersecurity, and writing as well.

As a programmer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.

I am very passionate about blockchain development, my future goal is to become a blockchain developer.
